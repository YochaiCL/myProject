        <h2 className={style.h2}>What are the Internal PC Cables?</h2>
        <p className={style.p}>
          Once you have installed the motherboard and power supply, fitted in
          the CPU, and slotted your RAM modules, itâ€™s time to connect all the
          cables on the board. Internal connectors are located inside a computer
          case. PC internal cables make the core of a computer.
        </p>
        <p className={style.p}>
          There are basically two main types of connectors found in the computer
          internally: socket connectors and power connectors.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Socket connectors are generally used to transfer data among devices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Power connectors, on the other hand, are responsible for supplying
            and distributing power to internal devices inside the computer.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className={style.h2}>SATA cables</h2>
        <p>
          Serial Advanced Technology Attachment cables are special types of
          cables, which are mainly used to connect multiple types of storage
          drives (optical drives, hard drives, solid-state drives) to a
          motherboard.
        </p>
        <h2 className={style.h2}>Fan cables</h2>
        <p>
          A motherboard fan connector is a small three or four-pin connector
          located on the motherboard. The fan will have one set of cables that
          will connect into the connector on the motherboard.
