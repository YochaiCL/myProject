          A power supply unit (PSU) converts mains AC to low-voltage regulated
          DC power for the internal components of a computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          If youâ€™ve calculated that your system is going to use 500 watts (a
          common number for a straightforward gaming build), choosing a PSU with
          600 or 650-watt output could be a good option, as it will give you
          some overhead to work with, and also allow for potential future
          upgrades.
